@W: MT531 :"c:\users\gabriela\desktop\practicas\palabra00\palabra00\source\mux00.vhdl":17:2:17:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 3 sequential elements including M03.outbcd_1[4].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\gabriela\desktop\practicas\palabra00\palabra00\source\cring00.vhdl":18:2:18:3|Found inferred clock topword00|clkr0 which controls 8 sequential elements including MO2.outr[3:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
