@W: MT531 :"c:\users\gabriela\desktop\practicasg\rom2\rom2\rom00\rom00.vhd":40:2:40:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 5 sequential elements including R002.outwordrom_1[5:4].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\gabriela\desktop\practicasg\rom2\rom2\rom00\div00.vhd":22:2:22:3|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 22 sequential elements including R001.OS01.sdiv[20:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
